  BUILD ZIP DEMO - File Archive Creation Demonstration

  This demonstration showcases the Game2D library's built-in ZIP file creation
  capabilities, providing developers with a practical example of how to
  programmatically build compressed archives from directory structures. The demo
  illustrates real-time progress monitoring, console output formatting, and
  error handling patterns essential for file operations in game development.

  Technical Complexity Level: Beginner

  OVERVIEW:
  The BuildZipDemo demonstrates the Tg2dZipFileIO.Build() method for creating
  ZIP archives from source directories. This functionality is crucial for game
  asset packaging, content distribution, and resource management systems. The
  demo emphasizes user feedback through colored console output and real-time
  progress reporting, making it an excellent reference for implementing similar
  file operations in production game projects.

  Primary educational objectives include understanding callback-based progress
  monitoring, proper error handling for file I/O operations, and effective
  user interface feedback patterns. Target audience includes game developers
  implementing asset packaging systems, mod support, or save game compression.

  TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
  The core system utilizes the Game2D library's Tg2dZipFileIO class, which
  provides a high-level wrapper around ZIP compression algorithms. The
  implementation follows a callback pattern where a progress procedure is
  passed to the Build() method, enabling real-time feedback during the
  compression process.

  Data structures involved:
  - String constants for file paths (LZipFilename, LSourceDir)
  - Anonymous procedure for progress callback handling
  - Boolean return value for operation success/failure indication

  The progress callback receives four parameters:
  - AFilename: Current file being processed (string)
  - AProgress: Completion percentage (Integer, 0-100)
  - ANewFile: Flag indicating start of new file processing (Boolean)
  - AUserData: Optional user-defined data pointer (Pointer)

  Memory management follows Delphi's automatic string management with no
  manual allocation required. The callback procedure operates in the context
  of the calling thread, ensuring thread-safe console operations.

  Key architectural decisions include separating UI feedback from core
  compression logic, using const parameters for immutable data, and
  implementing clear success/failure paths with appropriate visual indicators.

  FEATURES DEMONSTRATED:
  • ZIP archive creation from directory structures
  • Real-time progress monitoring with percentage completion
  • Color-coded console output for different message types
  • File-by-file processing feedback with filename display
  • Robust error handling with success/failure indication
  • Anonymous procedure implementation for callbacks
  • Console manipulation techniques (colors, formatting, positioning)
  • Carriage return usage for dynamic progress updates
  • ExtractFileName() utility for clean file display
  • Conditional formatting based on processing state

  RENDERING TECHNIQUES:
  Console rendering utilizes the Tg2dConsole class for cross-platform text
  output with color support. The implementation demonstrates:
  - Foreground color manipulation using predefined constants
  - Dynamic text updating using carriage return (G2D_CR) sequences
  - Formatted string output with parameter substitution
  - Strategic line breaks and spacing for visual clarity
  - Progress indication through overwriting previous output

  Color scheme implementation:
  - G2D_LIGHTCYAN: Initial status messages and headers
  - G2D_WHITE: Standard informational text and file paths
  - G2D_GREEN: Active processing feedback and file names
  - G2D_LIMEGREEN: Success confirmation messages
  - G2D_TOMATO: Error and failure indication

  CONTROLS:
  The demo operates autonomously with minimal user interaction:
  - Automatic execution upon procedure call
  - Console pause at completion requiring user input to continue
  - No real-time user controls during compression process
  - Standard console interaction for program termination

  MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
  Progress calculation within the ZIP building process:

    ProgressPercentage = (ProcessedBytes / TotalBytes) * 100

  File processing order follows directory traversal algorithms:
  - Recursive directory scanning for file enumeration
  - Sequential processing maintaining directory structure
  - Path normalization for cross-platform compatibility

  The compression ratio depends on file types and content:
    CompressionRatio = (OriginalSize - CompressedSize) / OriginalSize

  PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
  Expected performance metrics:
  - Processing speed: 10-50 MB/second depending on file types
  - Memory usage: 2-8 MB baseline plus 1-2x largest individual file size
  - Compression ratios: 20-80% depending on content type
  - Progress update frequency: Per-file basis with percentage granularity

  Optimization techniques employed:
  - Streaming compression to minimize memory footprint
  - Buffered I/O operations for improved disk performance
  - Callback-based progress to avoid blocking UI updates
  - Efficient string handling through const parameters

  Scalability considerations include handling directories with thousands of
  files, managing memory for large individual files, and maintaining
  responsive progress feedback for long operations.

  EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
  Developers studying this demo will learn essential patterns for:
  - Implementing file system operations with proper error handling
  - Creating responsive user interfaces for long-running operations
  - Using callback patterns for progress monitoring
  - Applying console formatting techniques for professional output
  - Structuring code for maintainability and reusability

  Transferable concepts include progress reporting patterns applicable to
  any long-running operation, color-coded user feedback systems, and
  callback-based architecture for event-driven programming.

  The progression demonstrates fundamental I/O operations that scale to
  more complex scenarios such as network file transfers, database
  operations, or asset processing pipelines.

  Real-world applications include game asset packaging systems, automatic
  backup utilities, mod distribution tools, and save game compression
  systems essential for modern game development workflows.
